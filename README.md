# Build the webview (React app)
npm run build-webview

# Build the extension
npm run compile

# Build both
npm run vscode:prepublish
```

```bash
# Watch webview changes
npm run watch-webview

# Watch extension changes
npm run watch
```

### Testing

2. Create a new sketch and test the functionality
3. Check the developer console for any errors

## Architecture

- **Extension**: TypeScript-based VS Code extension
- **Webview**: React app with TLDraw integration
- **Build**: Vite for webview bundling, TypeScript for extension compilation
- **Auto-Save**: Debounced, content-aware saving with deep equality checks
- **File Watching**: Self-trigger suppression to prevent reload loops


## Security & Privacy

SketchPrompt follows a security-first development approach with iterative security reviews. We ensure no release ships with major security issues by conducting regular security assessments and addressing vulnerabilities promptly.

**üìã [See detailed security information ‚Üí](SECURITY.md)**

### **Security Features**

- **Local Bundling**: Minimal external dependencies

### **Privacy**

SketchPrompt is designed with privacy in mind. All sketch data stays on your local machine and is never sent to external services.

**What We Don't Track:**
- ‚ùå **Personal data**: No user names, emails, or identities
- ‚ùå **Sketch content**: Your drawings and sketches are never sent anywhere
- ‚ùå **File names**: Individual file names or paths are not tracked
- ‚ùå **Workspace data**: Your project structure or workspace information
- ‚ùå **AI conversations**: Chat content or prompts are not tracked

**What's Coming:**
- üîí **Local-first approach**: All features will prioritize local processing
- ü§ù **Optional collaboration**: Future sharing features will be opt-in only
- üîê **End-to-end encryption**: For any future cloud features
- üìä **Privacy-focused analytics**: If implemented, will be anonymous and optional
