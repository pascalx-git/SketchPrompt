# SketchPrompt Security

**Extension**: SketchPrompt v0.2.4  
**Last Updated**: July 31 2025  
**Security Status**: 🟡 **PRODUCTION READY WITH CAVEATS**  
**Security Process**: Iterative review and improvement

---

## Security Commitment

SketchPrompt follows a security-first development approach with iterative security reviews. We ensure no release ships with major security issues by conducting regular security assessments and addressing vulnerabilities promptly.

Our current architecture prioritizes local processing and user privacy while maintaining the flexibility to add secure cloud features in the future.

### **Security Features**
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Hardened against XSS attacks
- **Input Validation**: All sketch data validated with JSON schema
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Secure file operations
- **Error Sanitization**: No information leakage in error messages
- **Local Bundling**: Minimal external dependencies

---

## Security Process

### **Pre-Release Security Review**
- Security assessment before each version release
- Vulnerability identification and remediation
- Security testing and validation

### **Ongoing Security Measures**
- **Iterative Security Reviews**: Regular assessments before each release
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Prompt identification and remediation
- **Dependency Audits**: Regular npm audit and security scanning
- **CSP Violation Monitoring**: Continuous Content Security Policy oversight
- **User Feedback**: Collection and analysis of security-related issues

### **Security Timeline**
- **Pre-Release**: Security assessment before each version
- **Vulnerability Remediation**: Prompt fixes for identified issues
- **Quarterly Deep Review**: Comprehensive security assessment
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing security oversight

## Testing & Validation

### ✅ **Security Tests**
- CSP violations blocked
- Input validation working
- Path traversal prevented
- Error sanitization active

### ✅ **Functionality Tests**
- TLDraw fully operational
- All drawing tools working
- Auto-save functioning
- File operations secure

### ✅ **Performance Tests**
- Extension size: 3.0MB (acceptable)
- Build time: < 10 seconds
- Memory usage: Normal

### ⚠️ **Dependency Tests**
- 2 moderate vulnerabilities in development dependencies
- xml2js prototype pollution (CVSS 6.5) - development only
- vsce dependency chain vulnerability - build tool only

---

## Risk Assessment

### **Current Security Posture**: 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK**
- ✅ CSP hardened (no unsafe directives)
- ✅ All dependencies bundled locally
- ✅ Input validation implemented
- ✅ Path traversal protection active
- ✅ Error information leakage prevented
- ✅ TLDraw functionality fully operational
- ⚠️ Development dependency vulnerabilities (xml2js, vsce)
- ⚠️ Supply chain risks in build tools

---

## Production Readiness

**Status**: 🟡 **READY WITH CAVEATS**

The extension is secure for production deployment, but development dependencies should be updated in the next release cycle. The vulnerabilities are in build tools only and do not affect the runtime security of the extension.

**Recommendation**: Safe to deploy to users, but address dependency vulnerabilities in next release.

## Privacy & Data Handling

SketchPrompt is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. Here's how we handle data:

### **Current Privacy Features**
- **Local processing**: All sketches and data stay on your machine
- **No data collection**: We don't track usage, errors, or performance metrics
- **No cloud dependencies**: No external services required for core functionality
- **No analytics**: No anonymous usage tracking or statistics collection

### **Future Privacy Considerations**
As we add AI and collaboration features, we will:
- **Maintain transparency**: Clear documentation of any data handling
- **Provide opt-out options**: Users can choose not to use cloud features
- **Use secure protocols**: Any future cloud features will use encryption and secure APIs
- **Minimize data collection**: Only collect what's absolutely necessary for functionality

### **Privacy Commitment**
- **User control**: You decide what data to share
- **Transparent practices**: Clear documentation of all data handling
- **Security-first**: Privacy and security are core design principles

## Version Comparison

### **v0.2.0 → v0.2.4 Security Improvements**
- ✅ **CSP Hardened**: Removed unsafe directives
- ✅ **Input Validation**: AJV schema validation implemented
- ✅ **Path Security**: Traversal protection active
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages
- ✅ **Local Bundling**: Minimal external dependencies

### **Current Concerns**
- ⚠️ xml2js prototype pollution (moderate, development only)
- ⚠️ vsce dependency chain vulnerability (build tool only)
- ⚠️ Development toolchain security

### **Immediate Actions Needed**
1. **Monitor vsce updates** for xml2js dependency fix
2. **Consider alternative packaging** methods if needed
3. **Implement automated security scanning** in CI/CD
