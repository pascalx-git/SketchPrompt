## Privacy & Data Handling

SketchPrompt is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. Here's how we handle data:

### **Current Privacy Features**
- **Local processing**: All sketches and data stay on your machine
- **No data collection**: We don't track usage, errors, or performance metrics
- **No cloud dependencies**: No external services required for core functionality
- **No analytics**: No anonymous usage tracking or statistics collection

### **Future Privacy Considerations**
As we add AI and collaboration features, we will:
- **Maintain transparency**: Clear documentation of any data handling
- **Provide opt-out options**: Users can choose not to use cloud features
- **Use secure protocols**: Any future cloud features will use encryption and secure APIs
- **Minimize data collection**: Only collect what's absolutely necessary for functionality

### **Privacy Commitment**
- **User control**: You decide what data to share
- **Transparent practices**: Clear documentation of all data handling
- **Security-first**: Privacy and security are core design principles
