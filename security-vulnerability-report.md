## Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### ðŸ”´ HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

#### 1. Content Security Policy with Dangerous Directives
**File:** `src/SketchPromptProvider.ts:59`, `src/SketchPromptCustomEditor.ts:111`  
**Vulnerability:** Use of `'unsafe-eval'` and `'unsafe-inline'` in CSP  
**CVSS Score:** 8.1 (High)

**Description:**
The webview Content Security Policy includes `'unsafe-eval'` and `'unsafe-inline'` directives, which significantly weaken security protections against XSS attacks.

```typescript
content="default-src 'self' https://cdn.tldraw.com; style-src ${webview.cspSource} 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.tldraw.com; script-src 'nonce-${nonce}' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.tldraw.com; img-src data: blob: https://cdn.tldraw.com; font-src https://cdn.tldraw.com; connect-src https://cdn.tldraw.com;"
```

**What Could Go Wrong:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts that bypass CSP protections, potentially accessing sensitive user data, manipulating the IDE, or executing arbitrary code within the extension context.

**How to Fix:**
1. Remove `'unsafe-eval'` and `'unsafe-inline'` from CSP
2. Use nonces for all inline styles and scripts
3. Move all inline CSS to external files
4. Configure TLDraw to work without eval() if possible

**Level of Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

---

#### 2. Unvalidated JSON Parsing
**File:** `src/SketchPromptCustomEditor.ts:24`  
**Vulnerability:** JSON.parse without input validation  
**CVSS Score:** 7.3 (High)

**Description:**
The application directly parses JSON content from user files without validation, potentially allowing malicious JSON payloads to cause crashes or unexpected behavior.

```typescript
const data = text ? JSON.parse(text) : {};
```

**What Could Go Wrong:**
A malicious `.sketchprompt` file could contain crafted JSON that crashes the extension, consumes excessive memory, or potentially exploits JSON parsing vulnerabilities.

**How to Fix:**
1. Implement JSON schema validation
2. Add try-catch blocks with proper error handling
3. Sanitize and validate parsed data structure
4. Implement size limits for JSON parsing

**Level of Effort:** Low (1 day)

---

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

#### 3. Insecure File System Operations
**File:** `src/extension.ts:40-50`  
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal and unsafe file operations  
**CVSS Score:** 6.1 (Medium)

**Description:**
File creation and directory operations lack proper path validation, potentially allowing directory traversal attacks.

```typescript
const sketchesFolder = path.join(rootPath, 'sketchprompt');
if (!fs.existsSync(sketchesFolder)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(sketchesFolder);
}
```

**What Could Go Wrong:**
An attacker could potentially create files outside the intended directory structure, overwrite system files, or access sensitive directories if workspace paths are manipulated.

**How to Fix:**
1. Validate and sanitize all file paths
2. Use path.resolve() and check paths are within expected boundaries
3. Implement proper access controls for file operations
4. Add path traversal protection

**Level of Effort:** Medium (2 days)

---

#### 4. External CDN Dependency Risk
**File:** `src/SketchPromptProvider.ts:59`, `src/SketchPromptCustomEditor.ts:111`  
**Vulnerability:** Dependency on external CDN (cdn.tldraw.com)  
**CVSS Score:** 5.8 (Medium)

**Description:**
The extension loads resources from an external CDN which could be compromised or become unavailable, affecting security and reliability.

**What Could Go Wrong:**
If the TLDraw CDN is compromised, malicious scripts could be served to users. Network issues could also break the extension functionality.

**How to Fix:**
1. Bundle TLDraw resources locally with the extension
2. Implement CSP hash validation for external resources
3. Add fallback mechanisms for offline use
4. Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources

**Level of Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)

---

#### 5. Insufficient Input Sanitization in Webview
**File:** `src/SketchPromptCustomEditor.ts:44-70`  
**Vulnerability:** Webview message handling without proper validation  
**CVSS Score:** 5.4 (Medium)

**Description:**
Messages received from the webview are processed without sufficient validation, potentially allowing malicious webview content to send crafted messages.

**What Could Go Wrong:**
Malicious sketch data could be used to manipulate file system operations, crash the extension, or access unintended resources.

**How to Fix:**
1. Implement message validation schemas
2. Sanitize all incoming webview messages
3. Add rate limiting for message processing
4. Validate message origins

**Level of Effort:** Low (1-2 days)

---

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES

#### 6. Dependency Vulnerabilities
**File:** `package.json`  
**Vulnerability:** Outdated dependencies with known CVEs  
**CVSS Score:** 3.7 (Low)

**Description:**
Several dependencies have known security vulnerabilities:
- Node.js version 20.19.2 has multiple CVEs (CVE-2025-23083, CVE-2025-23084, CVE-2025-23085)
- TLDraw version 3.13.4 may have undiscovered vulnerabilities

**What Could Go Wrong:**
Exploitation of known dependency vulnerabilities could lead to various security issues depending on the specific CVE.

**How to Fix:**
1. Update Node.js to version 20.18.2 or later
2. Update all dependencies to latest versions
3. Implement automated dependency scanning
4. Set up security monitoring for new CVEs

**Level of Effort:** Low (Half day)

---

#### 7. Information Disclosure via Error Messages
**File:** `src/SketchPromptCustomEditor.ts:30-40`  
**Vulnerability:** Detailed error messages in production  
**CVSS Score:** 2.9 (Low)

**Description:**
Error messages may expose internal system information that could aid attackers in reconnaissance.

**What Could Go Wrong:**
Attackers could gather information about file paths, system structure, or internal operations to plan more sophisticated attacks.

**How to Fix:**
1. Implement proper error message sanitization
2. Log detailed errors only in development mode
3. Provide generic error messages to users
4. Implement proper logging mechanisms

**Level of Effort:** Low (Half day)

## Summary & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (High Priority)
1. **Fix CSP vulnerabilities** - Remove unsafe directives and implement proper nonce-based security
2. **Add JSON validation** - Implement proper input validation for all JSON parsing operations

### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)
3. **Secure file operations** - Add path validation and traversal protection
4. **Bundle external dependencies** - Reduce reliance on external CDNs  
5. **Improve webview security** - Add message validation and sanitization

### Long-term Actions (Low Priority)
6. **Update dependencies** - Establish regular dependency update process
7. **Improve error handling** - Implement production-appropriate error messaging

### Overall Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Post-Remediation Risk Level:** LOW  

The application has several serious security vulnerabilities that should be addressed immediately, particularly the CSP and input validation issues. However, most vulnerabilities are relatively straightforward to fix with moderate development effort.

### Security Best Practices Recommendations
1. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Conduct regular dependency audits
3. Add comprehensive input validation throughout the application
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Consider security code reviews for all webview-related code
6. Add security testing to the development process
